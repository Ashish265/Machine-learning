# Machine learning projects 

1 - Decision Tree classifier:

In this project we will see how decision trees work by implementing a decision tree in sklearn to predict the chance of survival for Titanic Dataset.


2 - Naive Bayes:

In this project we will built a spam classifier to classify the email as spam or ham using a Naive Bayes algorithm.

3 - Ensemble Method

In this we will implement a spam classifier to classify the email as spam or ham using Random Forest, AdaBoost, SVC and compare the result with the Naive Bayes algorithm.

4 - Model Evaluation metrics

In this section we see the different metrics used for classification and Regression.

5 - Training Tunng

In this section we will optimize our model by performing hyperparameter tunning for different alogorithms.
